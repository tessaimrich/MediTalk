Apply Protopic as a thin layer to affected areas of your skin.

Protopic may be used on most parts of the body, including the face and neck and in the creases of your elbows and knees.

Avoid using the ointment inside your nose or mouth or in your eyes. If the ointment gets on any of these areas, it should be thoroughly wiped off and/or rinsed off with water.

Do not cover the skin being treated with bandages or wraps.

Wash your hands after applying Protopic unless your hands are also being treated.

Before applying Protopic after a bath or shower, be sure your skin is completely dry
